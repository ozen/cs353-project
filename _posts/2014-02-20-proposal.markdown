## Description

In this project, we design and implement a software to be used by a bus company. A bus company has to keep track of their buses, arrange their routes and schedule voyages. Then, the company sell tickets to customers based on this data. Therefore, a data-driven software is highly efficient tool for a bus company. The software can also be used to store personnel data, or obtain some statistics about routes. The management of the data can be solved by a relational model. Thus, a bus company data management system is a good case for using a RDBMS.
